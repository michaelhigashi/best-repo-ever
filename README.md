1 John 4:3
And if any spirit confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of antichrist; whereof you have heard it should come, and even now is in the world.

Hebrews 9:27
and it is appointed unto a man once to die, but after this comes the judgement.
